### Improved template listing

By lining up the sorted elements visually, order is injected into the

Example:

    $ g8 -l
              tjweir/LiftProject         giter8 template for a Lift 2.2 application
         typesafehub/akka-first-tutorial-java
                                         giter8 template for first Akka 2.0 tu
    [...]
