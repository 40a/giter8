### root layout

giter8 0.7.0 introduces an experimental layout called *root layout*.
When giter8 does not find `src/main/g8`, it will simply use the root directory
of the specified Git repository as the template directory.

The `default.properties` file can be placed either at the root directory
or in `project` directory.
Since you can no longer include template fields in the files
under `project` its application is very limited.
