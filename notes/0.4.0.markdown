This release includes template formatting options
[contributed by pvlugter][pvlugter], which allow templates to specify
transformations of property strings. For example, the same property
value could be leveraged in templates for a camel-cased classname and
for a normalized sbt project id (lowercase with hyphens).

See "Formatting template fields" in the [readme][readme] for usage
instructions.
