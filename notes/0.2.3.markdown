## new features
- giter8-plugin for sbt 0.11 adds `g8-test` task, which runs `src/test/g8/test` using scripted framework.
- a directory named `$package$` expands out to package dir structure (for example, `net.databinder` becomes `net/databinder`). [#19][19]
- files matching the patterns listed in `verbatim` are copied without processing (for example, `verbatim: *.js` leaves js files alone). [#21][21]

## bug fixes and minor updates
- switched to sbt 0.11.
- support for copying permission bits. [#24][24]
- fixes charset issue. [#26][26]
- changes github credential storage to `git config --global` or env vars. see [local github config][1]. [#10][10]
